          <h3>Persephone</h3>
<br />
<br />
<br />


Six months later.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />“This trip to Naraean was completely unnecessary,” I say, as I get down from Fotias into the gorgeous meadow we just landed on. “And why did you have to bring poor Fotias? He’s still exhausted from the military exercises earlier this week. We could have ridden phoenixes.”<br />
<br />At the sound of his name, the dragon waves his heavy tail softly, almost like a gigantic kitten, while looking down at me with curiosity.<br />
<br />Hades glares at me. “Hermes is your high priest. It’d look bad if you didn’t show up to his annual meeting with the lords of his kingdom. Fotias is always a strong reminder of our power, in case the lords decide to plot against us,” Hades says, as if explaining why the water is wet to a five-year-old.<br />
<br />He takes out a blanket and a picnic basket from Fotias’ saddlebag. Then he walks toward a huge wiping willow and extends the blanket on the grassy ground under it, placing the basket on top of the blanket.<br />
<br />As I walk toward our cozy lunch spot, Dasea shares her thoughts in my mind.<br />
<br />“Hades is up to something. I can feel it,” says Dasea. <br />
<br />“I know, I’m not letting him off the hook so easily, trust me,” I say.<br />
<br />“It’s weird because Vlasios won’t fess up what Hades’ deal is. It’s as if he’s covering for him,” she says.<br />
<br />“Well, Vlasios possessed Hades, it makes sense that they’re buddies now. But don’t worry, I know how to get to the bottom of this,” I say, as a naughty idea springs into my mind.<br />
<br />“Are you hungry?” Hades says as he rummages through the food inside the basket.<br />
<br />“You know I’m always hungry,” I say with a sultry voice as I sit down on the blanket beside him.<br />
<br />Hades stops and looks at me with narrowed eyes.<br />
<br />I ignore his sudden wariness and continue with my plan.<br />
<br />“Did you bring any grapes? They’re my favorite,” I say with eyes that undress every inch of his sculpted body.<br />
<br />“Yes. I asked the head chef to pack our lunch himself to ensure we got all our favorite snacks. The grapes must be here somewhere,” Hades says, a bit flustered.<br />
<br />“Here, found them,” he says, pulling a heavy bunch of plump, black grapes, and offering them to me.<br />
<br />I lock eyes with him and slightly open my mouth while remaining motionless at his gesture.<br />
<br />His gaze alights, focused on my open lips, as if he were picturing a similar part of my anatomy. He flashes a lopsided smile, and his fingers pull two grapes from the cluster, bringing them slowly to my mouth. <br />
<br />As my tongue and teeth greedily seize their juicy bounty, he abruptly removes one of the grapes bearing my bite mark on it, and eats it up.<br />
<br />Liquid sweetness explodes in my mouth, and I can feel the sunshine and the rainwater within the grape. I also feel Hades’ hand climbing up my thigh over my breeches, like a thirsty mountain lion on the prowl for the other sweetness flowing through my folds.<br />
<br />The softness of Hades’ lips on mine surprises me, and I moan as his strong hand grasps the back of my neck, as if securing his own bounty.<br />
<br />His tender caresses grow rougher as his bulge against my hip continues to harden. The mere thought of his meaty cock fucking me at night makes my pussy ache with desire.<br />
<br />His hands roam over the white silk of my blouse, squeezing my breasts in rage at the barrier posed by my clothing.<br />
<br />“I need to feel your skin against mine,” he whispers, already panting.<br />
<br />Before I can reply, his impatient fingers are halfway unbuttoning my blouse, while his other hand is cupping my butt, his fingers rubbing against my entrance. Hades removes my top and tosses it to the side, then with a quick snap he undoes my bra and sends it flying. The cool afternoon air triggers goosebumps on my skin. Hades notices my shrivers and immediately picks me up, placing me on his warm lap with my legs wrapped around his hips.<br />
<br />He tears his shirt, and in an instant, his muscular arms embrace me protectively, shielding me from the breeze. His long, wet tongue licks and sucks on my nipples, sending waves of pleasure all over my body. <br />
<br />I grind on his hard dick as it strains against his pants. The friction gets me so worked up that without thinking, I reach for this belt and start undressing him with frenzied hands, and when his thick cock bobs free, I grab it and play with it.<br />
<br />Hades groans and unbuttons my breeches. When he’s about to tear the fabric, I stop him, and get out of them as quickly as I can. He takes off his pants too and the next thing I know, I’m lying on the blanket and he has overpowered me with his heavy body on top of mine.<br />
<br />He grabs my wrists and pinned them down at my sides.<br />
<br />“This reminds me of our first time together,” he whispers to the shell of my ear, inhaling deeply into the crook of my neck and licking my skin.<br />
<br />I’m overcome by the image he evokes. The memory feels so distant yet so vivid, when this powerful young god ambushed me on a meadow similar to this one and defeated me in combat. That was a first for me.<br />
<br />I’ve never lost a battle before Hades. I’ve had numerous attempts on my life, as would any goddess worth her salt. However, I’ve never experienced such an attempt on my heart. And I once again lost irrevocably. He was too impetuous, too gorgeous to resist. So I gave in. <br />
<br />The far cry of a falcon brings me back to the present. Hades’ searing touch is so distracting that I almost forgot my plan. <br />
<br />One thing I’ll never give in again is to be driven by someone else’s agenda. And this is precisely what’s happening right now. <br />
<br />I clear my throat to ensure my voice will sound confident enough. But it’s too challenging to bridle my wild heart when Hades kisses my middle, dangerously approaching his final destination south of my navel. <br />
<br />“Did you know that”— I say, but a moan replaces my words, as Hades sucks on my clit, making me forget my conscious thoughts, and submerging me in an ocean of delight.<br />
<br />“Did I know what? That you have the most delectable cunt in the whole realm?” he says as he emerges from between my thighs. He licks his lips and ends the indecent display with a diabolical grin. <br />
<br />I writhe as two of his fingers penetrate me slowly, massaging my core in wicked ways.<br />
<br />I fight my pleasure and try to get hold of myself. I’ll be damned if I let him turn my strategy against me. I need to catch Hades off guard to get the truth about this sham of a trip.<br />
<br />“Did you know Thanatos and I are about to get a breakthrough on this new drug we’ve been working on? We’ve been using my primordial stem cells to create a new treatment that would help millions of humans”—<br />
<br />Hades stops his kissing abruptly. Even though his face’s buried between my legs, I can feel the scowl in the heavy breath he’s taking as if trying to calm the storm brewing inside him.<br />
<br />“Do you mean the reason I’ve barely seen you in over three months?” he says, punctuating every word with the restrained fury of a jilted lover.<br />
<br />“We’ve been swamped. Creating a borderline miracle cure is not a straightforward”—<br />
<br />“Yes, I’ve been told how busy you two have been,” he says, sitting down. <br />
<br />“Do not interrupt me. You know it pisses me off. If you have a problem with me spending time with Thanatos, then you shouldn’t have sworn a blood oath to him agreeing to share me,” I say as I sit down too.<br />
<br />“How was I supposed to know that he’d hog up your time with his stupid experiments?” he says, raking his hair.<br />
<br />“Saving human lives is not stupid. You know how important this is to me. I was made to believe I could die at a moment’s notice because of some strange disease that turned out to be fake. I know the debilitating agony of living with impending doom every minute, wondering if it’s my last. For these people, the horror is real, not some imaginary illness. Millions of lives are lost pointlessly. How can you be upset that I’m investing my time trying to help them?” I say.<br />
<br />“I’m not upset about that.”<br />
<br />“Then what’s your problem? Because I know this trip was an excuse to get me away from Thanatos.”<br />
<br />He moves so fast that by the time I realize what he’s doing it’s too late. He grabbed me by the hips and impaled me on his hard cock. I gasp for air, as his heavy hand constricts my windpipe and his other hand grips my ass, lifting me and pushing me down his dick forcefully.<br />
<br />The burning from having his cock rammed into me, turns into the most exhilarating mix of pain and an exuberant sensation of fullness and pleasure.<br />
<br />My walls contract with tingling waves when each of his primal strokes fills me with his hot, pulsing length.<br />
<br />“I will not be replaced, least of all by a queen-stealing, Goddess-fucker fae!” he growls with bottomless hatred as he plunges even harder into me.<br />
<br />Something in the way he said it led me to believe Hades didn’t refer to fae kings fucking primordial goddesses, but one of the Twelve Goddesses. <br />
<br />“How did you know that fae”—I say, but then the maddening rhythm of his cock overtakes my breathing, mind, everything. I can’t think anymore. Nothing exists but his sweaty, scorching body rubbing against me and his hard cock claiming my flesh.<br />
<br />Hades sears my skin with his jealousy, and I succumb to him as he enters me a thousand times with possessive rage. <br />
<br />Piercing pain screams from the side of my neck. I shake with pleasure as Hades sucks on my punctured skin, getting drunk on my blood and hastening his frenzied possession of my body. <br />
<br />Just when my body is about to fall apart from the ecstasy, the hand clawing my ass, slides a finger in between my butt cheeks. Before I know it, a slight pressure builds gradually until it penetrates my sensitive ring of muscle. He first thumbs my hole in a playful, almost innocent way, before transforming into a most deviant pleasure.<br />
<br />“You were mine first, before any of the other gods. And mine you will be forever. Each part of you, each hole belongs to me, mine to fuck, mine to claim, mine to possess,” he whispers, panting into my ear with a sweet, metallic breath. <br />
<br />The hand that has been embracing my back, crushing me against his chest, now pulls on my hair, hard.<br />
<br />“Tell me you need my cock. Tell me I’m your king and that you’re mine forever,” he snarls as he burrows his fingers into my hips.<br />
<br />His violence sends a rush of wetness to my core. The pain and pleasure overloads my judgment, leaving me only with my most primitive senses. <br />
<br />“Yes, my king. I want your cock fucking me deep. I’ll be yours until the end of time,” I say, panting, letting the words flow from my mouth, barely grasping their meaning.<br />
<br />A second finger passes through my threshold, and I squirm at the decadent stretching unleashing waves of wicked delight. It drives me crazy with lust to know that he craves the dirtiest parts of my body with such hunger. As I arch my back with the release, his dick pulses and twitches, his whole body shakes as he spills his hot seed into my depths.<br />
<br />After we catch our breath, he turns to kiss me.<br />
<br />“Wait, you haven’t told me the real reason why you brought me on this trip to Naraean?” I say too fast, as my heart tries to come down from the high of his scorching touch.<br />
<br />Hades’ face is still flushed from the effort of lovemaking, but a deeper shade of red unleashes on his sweaty skin. He looks like an embarrassed teenager, not like the ancient god of gods that he is.<br />
<br />“Something is wrong. I can feel a titan’s power rising dangerously,” Dasea says with a tone as somber as the witches’ hour.<br />
<br />A black sinkhole opens underneath our blanket, swallowing me into a whirlpool of dread.<br />
<br />“What do you mean?” I ask Dasea. My mind is clouded by memories of my terrible encounter with Koglothiros.<br />
<br />A high-pitched screech halts our conversation. Our heads snap up in the direction of the sound.<br />
<br />A falcon dives down in our direction. <br />
<br />Oh no. Not again.<br />
<br />Did the conspirators organize another uprising so soon? Which titan have they made their ally? What city is being threatened? Will I die again? <br />
<br />When the falcons lands on our blanket, Hades takes the little metal cylinder tied to its little leg. He unscrews the lid, takes out the paper with the message and reads it.<br />
<br />His eyes widen as the glowing flush drains from his face, leaving a pale, ashen parlor in its wake.<br />
<br />“It’s from Thanatos. A titan possessing a river is flooding a valley in Levaris, a fae territory. It will reach a town soon. We have to go now,” Hades says.<br />
<br />I shudder at his words. Just when everything was perfect, this happens. Why now? <br />
<br />We dress in a hurry and wake up Fotias, who had been napping after lunch. Hades mounts first and then helps me up, sitting me in front of him, in the same saddle. He screams his command to Fotias and we soar through the sky, leaving Naraean behind.<br />
<br />Throughout our flight, I recoil at what we must go through. But it’s all so sudden, so strange. <br />
<br />“What can you tell me about what’s happening with the titan?” I ask Dasea in my thoughts.<br />
<br />“Not much. Vlasios knew this titan better than I did. This titan’s name is Akios. He’s always been known for his playful disposition. He used to prank other titans when we were free during the first world. But perhaps that has changed and he has grown bitter with the passing of centuries in captivity,” Dasea says cautiously.<br />
<br />“Okay, what can you sense from his energy?” I say, desperate to get any bit of information that might give me an edge. I have Dasea and Vlasios on my side, but I don’t want to risk it. What if this titan forged an alliance with other titans in the area and they gang up on us? <br />
<br />“It’s difficult to say. The titan’s power ebbs and flows as their temperament fluctuates, but this surge is abnormal. Typically, when other beings harm their environment, such as cutting down a forest in a mountain where a titan resides, they attack the offender. However, the fae love nature, and as far as I am aware, they haven’t done anything to warrant this rage.”<br />
<br />The keyword here is ‘aware.’ What if, unbeknown to us, the scorned lords hired someone to poison the river in Levaris, so the titan would rise against the fae? That way the lords would punish Thanatos for his loyalty to Hades. The lords know we’d be called to defend the fae. What if the conspirators lie in wait with dark arts to kill us? This has to be a trap. What else could it be? And why hasn’t Hades confessed the real reason he brought me here? It’s too much of a coincidence that this occurred when I happened to be here.<br />
<br />Did Hades know something about this titan thing, and keep it from me until it blew up in his face, and that’s why he brought me here today? Is he keeping secrets again? And how on Earth did the falcon know where Hades was to deliver the message?<br />
<br />The more I think about it, the more splinters spring in my mind, needling at me with questions. Things don’t add up. <br />
<br />“Dasea, darling, please be careful. Something is going on and I don’t like it at all,” I say to her.<br />
<br />“Yes, likewise. Even Vlasios is acting up, I don’t understand why,” Dasea says.<br />
<br />Hades taps on my shoulder, cutting off my internal musings. He points down. <br />
<br />My heart sinks, this is no prank. I sadly recognize the place. After our battle with Casios, Thanatos took me on an aerial tour of Levaris, his kingdom. During our flight, the phoenix showed us the verdant mountains, hundreds of miles of willful rivers, and bountiful fields with colorful crops. This is one of those fields. Well, it used to be, and now it’s just a giant lake. Hundreds of crops have drowned. How many fae will go hungry because of his tantrum? How many mothers running with their babies in their arms will die when the flash flood reaches their village and vanish them under the muddy waters?<br />
<br />No. I can’t let this happen. Rage overflows in my veins like these dark waters. This titan will pay. <br />
<br />As if on cue, I spot the titan Akios. I never noticed them before Dasea possessed me, but now that she’s in me, I can tell titans apart from the natural landscapes they live in. It’s too weird to put in words, but I can distinguish an ethereal presence animating a large wave that moves through the flooded valley. It’s him. He slides with majestic calm, blissfully oblivious to the devastation his mood swings cause. Arrogant prick. I’ll send him to meet the Bloody Goddesses even if it’s the last thing I do.<br />
<br />“We have to go down and talk to him, see what he wants, and negotiate,” says Hades loudly into my ear, trying to be heard amid the whistling gusts of wind surrounding us. Then he motions for Fotias to start his descent. <br />
<br />I turn back to let him see my indignation.<br />
<br />“Negotiate? Are you insane? This bastard is a terrorist, and I don’t negotiate with scum like him,” I say.<br />
<br />“What? No. Persephone, I know how these things go, this is not the way”—<br />
<br />“Fuck your ways. If you hadn’t been so busy spying on Thanatos and me, you would have seen this coming, and these crops could have been saved. Now Thanatos’ people will starve because of your jealousy,” I scream.<br />
<br />“No, this is not what happened. You need to listen to me.”<br />
<br />A dark thought spreads like gangrene in the back of my mind. Why is Hades defending this monster? Why is he so eager for me to get closer to the titan without readying myself to attack? What if the lords’ black magic reached Hades and he’s leading me into a trap? Is that why even Vlasios won’t tell Dasea what the heck is going on?<br />
<br />“I sense danger, I think Hades has been compromised, and so has Vlasios. We need to kill this titan before he attacks us,” I say in my thoughts to Dasea.<br />
<br />“Yes, I suspect the same. Vlasios has never hidden things from me. This has to be a trap,” says Dasea.<br />
<br />“On the count of three, ready?”<br />
<br />“Always. And Persephone?”<br />
<br />“Yes?”<br />
<br />“It’s been an honor to fight alongside you,”<br />
<br />“Likewise. Let’s pray to the Mothers that this won’t be the last.”<br />
<br />“Yes. Let’s get this bastard what he deserves.”<br />
<br />“One. Two. Three!”<br />
<br />I scratch Hades’ hands with my nails, so he’d let go of his tight grip around my waist, and I skydive off Fotias into the tumultuous waters.<br />
<br />“Persephone, no!” Hades yells, though I only hear a faint sound amid the loud wind blowing all over me.<br />
<br />I look up, and I see that Hades has jumped too and is chasing me.<br />
<br />“There’s no time, we have to stop Akios,” I say to Dasea.<br />
<br />“Yes, invoke the field,” Dasea says.<br />
<br />It’s hard to keep my attention when the violent wind marionettes my body into all sorts of positions, and a massive wall of water rapidly rises to meet me. Akios is readying himself to attack me.<br />
<br />I won’t die in vain. <br />
<br />I hold myself steady in the middle of the sky, in front of the water column. With all my strength, I summon the electromagnetic field.<br />
<br />Two arcs of energy are forming, and the final beam courses through my body, filling me with the power of the ancient ones.<br />
<br />“What? Vlasios, leave me alone, you traitor! W-what do you mean? Oh no!” Dasea says in panicked thoughts. <br />
<br />I’ve never heard her talk to Vlasios before in my mind. He must be reaching out to her in an incredibly aggressive manner for her to scream her thoughts this way.<br />
<br />“Persephone stop! We were wrong!” Dasea shouts into my mind. <br />
<br />What? Did the enemy got hold of Dasea too? What’s happening?<br />
<br />But it’s too late, the field, ever obedient to my command as the daughter of the Goddesses, has unleashed its vast energy inside me and is rapidly accumulating. If I don’t discharge it now, it’ll kill me, even with Dasea’s strong spirit to channel it.<br />
<br />I’m about to kill Akios when Dasea’s warning haunts me. What if she’s telling the truth? She’s never lied to me before. In a split of a second, I redirect the energy into the air, right next to the water column. The power dissipates as spectacular fireworks coupled with numerous light bolts and auroras.<br />
<br />Akios roars and the water column shakes and retreats as if afraid.<br />
<br />“What the fuck, Hades! This is not what we planned! She almost killed me!” Akios screams in an inhuman rumble, as if his vocal cords were the sound of the water crashing in a million waves.<br />
<br />“Plan? What plan? Were you involved in this?” I yell at Hades as he approaches me in the air.<br />
<br />Hades is white as lighting and just as shocked.<br />
<br />“You weren’t supposed to go berserk!” Hades says to me. Then he turns to Akios.<br />
<br />“Calm down, it’s all a misunderstanding! She won’t hurt you, I swear!” Hades says to the water colossus.<br />
<br />I turn to Hades. I’m so angry my hands itch to strangle him.<br />
<br />“Talk for yourself! This fucker threatened to drown Thanatos’ people and you’re defending him? I ought to kill you first! Whose side are you on?” <br />
<br />“It’s not what it looks like!” Hades says to me.<br />
<br />“That’s what a traitor would say!” I’m reading to invoke the field again, before Hades buys more time with his sweet words and sets another trap.<br />
<br />“Screw you Hades! I tried to help you, and this is how you repay me? A true death ambush? You gods are crazier than me, I’m out!” Akios bellows and the gigantic wall of water starts its long descent.<br />
<br />“What the hell is going on?” I scream to Hades.<br />
<br />A clicking noise, followed by happy squeaks and whistles, draw my attention below, to the receding water column.<br />
<br />“Skippy! What are you doing here? Go back! It’s not safe for you here!” I shout.<br />
<br />Then I notice something even more peculiar. Two other adzes, wearing cute pink bows around their necks, follow Skippy. My jaw drops when I see that Skippy is wearing a golden bow himself, and he’s carrying a golden ribbon with a shiny object in his mouth.<br />
<br />Skippy swims up, his fins and tails vigorously flapping, propelling him upward. He pirouettes up in the air and opens his mouth, throwing the golden ribbon at me.<br />
<br />I jump to catch it and I gasp. It’s the most gorgeous diamond ring I’ve ever seen. A large, round diamond is set in the center, with five other medium size gems around it, as if they were petals to a flower.<br />
<br />“I’m sorry, I screw this up,” Hades says in a low tone, looking down as Akios recedes the waters back into the confines of the river bank.<br />
<br />“Hades, what in the ever fuck did just happen?” I say, my hands still shaking.<br />
<br />“I thought that since Thanatos and you spent so much time together developing that treatment, you’d chosen him over me, and eventually, you’d leave me for him. I thought that perhaps a grand gesture would convince you to come back to me. I remembered how disappointed you were at your coronation when I didn’t say that I loved you back, and I wanted to make it up to you. I guess it backfired,” Hades says, still not able to look at me.<br />
<br />“I almost killed an innocent titan. No, wait. Akios did flood the crops, isn’t that going to affect the fae folk?” I say.<br />
<br />“No. You see, that field is planted with neramin, it’s a type of cereal that requires an ungodly amount of water to grow. We always ask Akios to flood the valley when there hasn’t been enough rain, which has been the case this season.”<br />
<br />“I see. But if this is normal, who sent the falcon with the message then?” <br />
<br />Hades swallows, evading my gaze. <br />
<br />He doesn’t need to tell me. Skippy’s participation is enough proof. <br />
<br />“Hermes, of course. You took advantage of his long rivalry with Thanatos to convince him to be your accomplice. How did I not see it? While I was bored to tears talking to all those stuck-up lords at the meeting in Hermes’ castle, you were telling Hermes where to find us, so the falcon would deliver the message in front of me. And since Ares is your buddy, he must have sent the twins to train Skippy for this stunt.”<br />
<br />Red shame blooms in Hades’ face. <br />
<br />I throw the ring at this face.<br />
<br />“How could you! Skippy could have gotten hurt! Dasea and I could have gotten killed! You even dragged poor Vlasios into your scheme. Dasea was worried sick because Vlasios wouldn’t confess what was really happening.”<br />
<br />Hades grabs me by the waist. His fingers clawed at me as if I were to disappear.<br />
<br />“I did it for you! Fae kings have the worst reputation. I feared that you’d fallen for him. That you’d chosen him,” he says, his eyes burning with a fervor that melts me.<br />
<br />“What does that even mean? You swore to him that he could have me too!”<br />
<br />“Yes, but that was before, I don’t want to share you anymore!”<br />
<br />“You can’t go back on your word, you’re a god.”<br />
<br />“Fuck godhood. I only know that I want you with me all the time,” he says as he strokes my cheek with a tenderness that should be impossible for a hand as strong as his.<br />
<br />I feel for him. I really do. But he’s going back to his old ways, and I can’t have that.<br />
<br />“Hades,” I say, caressing his face back. “If you had to choose one of the gods, and forsake the friendship of the other two, who’d you choose?”<br />
<br />His brows knit together as he considers my question. His sensuous lips purse with indecision, while his eyes search for an answer he knows he won’t find.<br />
<br />Finally, his shoulders slouch with defeat.<br />
<br />“That’s exactly how I feel. I know you’ve been through thick and thin with these gods. If even you, with your jealousy for Thanatos, cannot cut him loose, how do you think I feel?”<br />
<br />“I just don’t want to lose you.”<br />
<br />“I don’t either, but there are things that are important to me, and I need you to respect that, and don’t try to manipulate me into doing what you want. I can’t be with someone like that. If you ever lose me, it’ll be because of your own doing, not because of anyone else.”<br />
<br />“But how can I let you go when it burns me inside to see you leave?” he says, his face a tangle of pain and longing.<br />
<br />“Setting me free is how you get to keep me,” I say. <br />
<br />His forehead touches mine, as his corded arms embrace me.<br />
<br />“Will you marry me?” he says with a velvet whisper.<br />
<br />“Only if you promise I’ll be free to traverse worlds,” I say.<br />
<br />After a long pause and a deep exhale, Hades says, “you’ll be free as the celestial ones to cross between the worlds of light and darkness. You’ll be the sun to rule the day. You’ll be the moon to rule the night. Only if you promise to come back to me.”<br />
<br />I smile. <br />
<br />“I’ll be the light of your days, and the fire of your nights, forever,” I say.<br />
<br />We seal our vows with a kiss that transports me to the first time we met, when his passion changed me.<br />
<br />“I guess this means a celebration is in place,” he says with a boyish grin.<br />
<br />“What do you mean?” I say, confused.<br />
<br />Hades chuckles as he raises his right hand into the dusk sky. A fireball escapes his fingertips. <br />
<br />Down below, on one of the tallest trees, another fireball gleams in response to his signal.<br />
<br />A few moments later, a large boat appears on the river. It glides over the deep waters with ease, seemingly helped by a generous current flowing suddenly.<br />
<br />The boat’s upper deck is decorated with red pomegranate flowers, with tall torches that give out a cozy and romantic ambiance.<br />
<br />“What’s that?” I ask Hades.<br />
<br />“That’s our party boat. All the gang is waiting for us there, come on,” he says as he takes my hand, and we head down to the celebration.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />The end. <br />
