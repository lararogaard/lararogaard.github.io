Hades


The Goddesses are bloodthirsty tonight, I think to myself as I shake the informant’s blood and guts off my arms. The meeting with our contact ended up being another trap to kill us.
I could ask Ares to call the driver to take us to our next appointment, but on nights like this, I need to walk in the cold, dark air to clear my mind. This solstice night is colder than usual, and I welcome its cleansing breeze.
A full moon shines down on us as we walk on the seedy streets of the Bronx. The moonlight reveals my bloodied appearance to the murmuring humans scampering alongside us. I scowl. I can feel the moon taunting me, it has betrayed me once again, unpunished, as it did centuries ago on that catastrophic night.
<br />
“We don’t have time for this. We need to find her. The usurpers are hot on our heels,” I say to Ares as he walks by my side.
<br />
“This guy is our best bet. Everything he told us checked out,” Ares says, taking out his phone to check his messages.
<br />
I groan. We’re running out of time. Lives are being lost in the battle against the supplanters who seek to overthrow my reign. We need her. I need her. She’s the only one who can stop the wailing shadows that assail me since the humans murdered my mother. I exhale all my hopelessness with force, as if doing so would exorcise it from my soul. In the chilly night, the white dance of my breath is a specter who assumes her delicate form with flowing hair, and full lips calling my name in dreams.
The vision transports me to a distant land, filled with warmth and ripe fruit-laden fields, where twin suns caress us during the day, and the moon guards us at night. If only I could find her—
<br />
“This is the place,” Ares says.
<br />
We are standing in front of a dilapidated warehouse. Graffiti covers the walls. The stench of piss and heartbreak clings to us like a rejected lover. The sensation that something terrible is about to happen assaults me. But I keep my mouth shut. I carry on even though everything in me tells me to run. Any risk is worth it if this man knows where she is.
<br />
As instructed by our contact, Ares knocks the keyword in Morse code on the door.
The door opens. A pale man in his early twenties sneaks his head out. He looks around with a mixture of mistrust and fear, as a timid mouse emerges from its hole in the kitchen wall, watching out for the cat.
<br />
“Which one of you is the Dark Lord?” he says.
<br />
I step forward. “That’s one of my names.”
<br />
“It’s an honor, sir. I’ve heard so much about you. My name is Pete,” he says as he extends his hand, a wave of admiration and relief washing over him.
<br />
I shake his hand while asking curtly, “where is she?”
<br />
Pete snorts. “You wouldn’t believe it. She’s been hiding in plain sight! Her genes are a masterpiece”—
<br />
“We don’t have time. Where is”—
<br />
A pinging sound causes my head to turn back toward the black-clad motorcyclist throwing the live grenade at us.
I try to send it back, but it’s too late. The shock wave has already knocked us back. My hand still holds Pete’s, though his body is twenty feet away. Disoriented and with ringing ears, I get to my feet amid the smoke and fire.
I must have had multiple injuries from the explosion. Still, all I can feel is my rage exploding with the force of a nuclear bomb. The bike skids, launching the black rider into the air, and I slam him against a nearby pole. His skull resembles a Halloween pumpkin carved with dynamite.
<br />
A black sedan without plates speeds toward us, with a machine gun pointed in our direction.
Ares shifts into his wolf form, his clothes torn, and runs toward the car, knocking the machine gun outside the window while he gets inside. After a few seconds, two bloodied arms fly off the vehicle.
<br />
The car crashes into a parked truck, and the driver’s mushy remains burst through the windshield and land on the street with a wet thud.
<br />
As a warrior, Ares enjoys sending messages without words.
“I can’t believe how much you enjoy showing off,” I say to Ares as he approaches me naked and covered in blood from head to toe.
<br />
He spits out a chunk of flesh with disgust.
<br />
“I hate it when they’re high. I get this nasty buzz.” He thrashes his head as if to expel the toxins he has just absorbed. Ares redirects his curious gaze to me. “You don’t look too hot. When was the last time you slept?”
<br />
I haven’t slept in a week. Whenever I try, I jolt awake from my vivid dreams about her and can’t go back to sleep.
Throughout the day, my mind dwells solely on her. I’m exhausted from using my powers nonstop every day to counteract these assassination attempts.
I’m at the end of my rope, and it’s tightening around my neck by the second.
<br />
I can’t believe our fucking luck. “Did Hermes and Thanatos have any luck with their informant?” I say.
<br />
“No. Hermes texted me. It was a dud,” says Ares.
<br />
Fuck.
<br />
“Do we have more tips?” I say with slim hope.
<br />
Ares bites his lips into a straight line and shakes his head.
<br />
Our last hope is gone.
“Ares, call Mira, tell her she’ll represent us tonight at the merger signing at the clown’s house. Then call the driver to pick up Hermes and Thanatos and then come for us here. We’re going home. I’m fucking done for the night,” I say. Blood, sweat, and hell knows what else covers my body. I need a shower.
<br />
“It’s a bad idea if you don’t show up at the merger banquet tonight. Pagonis is a sensitive man. He got you an expensive antique to commemorate the merger. If you don’t show up, he might take the slight to heart and cancel the deal,” Ares says.
<br />
“He’s broke. He can’t afford to call it off. Hermes can hack into their systems and discover the actual source of the drug.”
<br />
Ares shakes his head.
“Hermes has been trying to do that for weeks. Still nothing. What if there are no records of the active ingredient in their systems? If what we suspect about the drug is true, Pagonis wouldn’t be so stupid as to put it in black and white. The merger might be our only real chance to find out the truth about it. Do you want to risk losing her over a long shot?” he says.
<br />
I groan. Ares is right. How I wish he wasn’t.
“Fine, we’ll go,” I say as I rake my fingers through my hair. “But it’ll be a quick in-and-out business, no scenes, no drama, understood?”
