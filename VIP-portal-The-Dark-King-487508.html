          <h3>Chapter 1: Hades</h3>
<br />
<br />
<br />

The Goddesses are bloodthirsty tonight, I think to myself as I shake the informant’s blood and guts off my arms. The meeting with our contact ended up being another trap to kill us.
I could ask Ares to call the driver to take us to our next appointment, but on nights like this, I need to walk in the cold, dark air to clear my mind. This solstice night is colder than usual, and I welcome its cleansing breeze.
<br />
<br />
A full moon shines down on us as we walk on the seedy streets of the Bronx. The moonlight reveals my bloodied appearance to the murmuring humans scampering alongside us. I scowl. I can feel the moon taunting me, it has betrayed me once again, unpunished, as it did centuries ago on that catastrophic night.
<br />
<br />
“We don’t have time for this. We need to find her. The usurpers are hot on our heels,” I say to Ares as he walks by my side.
<br />
<br />
“This guy is our best bet. Everything he told us checked out,” Ares says, taking out his phone to check his messages.
<br />
<br />
I groan. We’re running out of time. Lives are being lost in the battle against the supplanters who seek to overthrow my reign. We need her. I need her. She’s the only one who can stop the wailing shadows that assail me since the humans murdered my mother. I exhale all my hopelessness with force, as if doing so would exorcise it from my soul. In the chilly night, the white dance of my breath is a specter who assumes her delicate form with flowing hair, and full lips calling my name in dreams.
The vision transports me to a distant land, filled with warmth and ripe fruit-laden fields, where twin suns caress us during the day, and the moon guards us at night. If only I could find her—
<br />
<br />
“This is the place,” Ares says.
<br />
<br />
We are standing in front of a dilapidated warehouse. Graffiti covers the walls. The stench of piss and heartbreak clings to us like a rejected lover. The sensation that something terrible is about to happen assaults me. But I keep my mouth shut. I carry on even though everything in me tells me to run. Any risk is worth it if this man knows where she is.
<br />
<br />
As instructed by our contact, Ares knocks the keyword in Morse code on the door.
The door opens. A pale man in his early twenties sneaks his head out. He looks around with a mixture of mistrust and fear, as a timid mouse emerges from its hole in the kitchen wall, watching out for the cat.
<br />
<br />
“Which one of you is the Dark Lord?” he says.
<br />
<br />
I step forward. “That’s one of my names.”
<br />
<br />
“It’s an honor, sir. I’ve heard so much about you. My name is Pete,” he says as he extends his hand, a wave of admiration and relief washing over him.
<br />
<br />
I shake his hand while asking curtly, “where is she?”
<br />
<br />
Pete snorts. “You wouldn’t believe it. She’s been hiding in plain sight! Her genes are a masterpiece”—
<br />
<br />
“We don’t have time. Where is”—
<br />
<br />
A pinging sound causes my head to turn back toward the black-clad motorcyclist throwing the live grenade at us.
I try to send it back, but it’s too late. The shock wave has already knocked us back. My hand still holds Pete’s, though his body is twenty feet away. Disoriented and with ringing ears, I get to my feet amid the smoke and fire.
I must have had multiple injuries from the explosion. Still, all I can feel is my rage exploding with the force of a nuclear bomb. The bike skids, launching the black rider into the air, and I slam him against a nearby pole. His skull resembles a Halloween pumpkin carved with dynamite.
<br />
<br />
A black sedan without plates speeds toward us, with a machine gun pointed in our direction.
Ares shifts into his wolf form, his clothes torn, and runs toward the car, knocking the machine gun outside the window while he gets inside. After a few seconds, two bloodied arms fly off the vehicle.
<br />
<br />
The car crashes into a parked truck, and the driver’s mushy remains burst through the windshield and land on the street with a wet thud.
<br />
<br />
As a warrior, Ares enjoys sending messages without words.
“I can’t believe how much you enjoy showing off,” I say to Ares as he approaches me naked and covered in blood from head to toe.
<br />
<br />
He spits out a chunk of flesh with disgust.
<br />
<br />
“I hate it when they’re high. I get this nasty buzz.” He thrashes his head as if to expel the toxins he has just absorbed. Ares redirects his curious gaze to me. “You don’t look too hot. When was the last time you slept?”
<br />
<br />
I haven’t slept in a week. Whenever I try, I jolt awake from my vivid dreams about her and can’t go back to sleep.
Throughout the day, my mind dwells solely on her. I’m exhausted from using my powers nonstop every day to counteract these assassination attempts.
I’m at the end of my rope, and it’s tightening around my neck by the second.
<br />
<br />
I can’t believe our fucking luck. “Did Hermes and Thanatos have any luck with their informant?” I say.
<br />
<br />
“No. Hermes texted me. It was a dud,” says Ares.
<br />
<br />
Fuck.
<br />
<br />
“Do we have more tips?” I say with slim hope.
<br />
<br />
Ares bites his lips into a straight line and shakes his head.
<br />
<br />
Our last hope is gone.
“Ares, call Mira, tell her she’ll represent us tonight at the merger signing at the clown’s house. Then call the driver to pick up Hermes and Thanatos and then come for us here. We’re going home. I’m fucking done for the night,” I say. Blood, sweat, and hell knows what else covers my body. I need a shower.
<br />
<br />
“It’s a bad idea if you don’t show up at the merger banquet tonight. Pagonis is a sensitive man. He got you an expensive antique to commemorate the merger. If you don’t show up, he might take the slight to heart and cancel the deal,” Ares says.
<br />
<br />
“He’s broke. He can’t afford to call it off. Hermes can hack into their systems and discover the actual source of the drug.”
<br />
<br />
Ares shakes his head.
“Hermes has been trying to do that for weeks. Still nothing. What if there are no records of the active ingredient in their systems? If what we suspect about the drug is true, Pagonis wouldn’t be so stupid as to put it in black and white. The merger might be our only real chance to find out the truth about it. Do you want to risk losing her over a long shot?” he says.
<br />
<br />
I groan. Ares is right. How I wish he wasn’t.
“Fine, we’ll go,” I say as I rake my fingers through my hair. “But it’ll be a quick in-and-out business, no scenes, no drama, understood?”


<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<h3>Chapter 2: Persephone</h3>
<br /><br />
<br />I sneak through the service staff corridors at Mr. Pagonis’ garish McMansion to spy on the sexy gods attending a banquet in the formal dining room. The gods are here to sign their acquisition of Mr. Pagonis’ biological research company. <br />
<br />But tonight, I’m not alone. My best friend Hellen tags along, though reluctantly. Like me, she also works as a maid for Mr. Pagonis.<br />
<br />“I’m going to lose my marbles! All the gods are here! They’re so hot. Which one is your favorite?” I say.<br />
<br />Hellen glares at me.<br />
<br />“Favorite? Are you crazy, Perse? I’m terrified they’ll go bananas and kill us all, as they’ve done so many times. The government gives them billions because of the drugs they produce. They buy senators so they can do whatever they want. They’re dangerous,” she whispers.<br />
<br />I stop in my tracks and look back at her. “Way to kill the vibe, Hellen. Besides, the gods only mess with you if you mess with them. That sounds reasonable.”<br />
<br />Hellen loves to rag on the gods. I don’t know anyone who hates their guts more than she does. But who am I to judge? I’m weird myself, courtesy of growing up isolated, with the Internet as my electronic pacifier.<br />
<br />It didn’t help that Mr. Pagonis—my legal guardian after my mom died—chose a parade of sketchy tutors to homeschool me.<br />
<br />Hellen glances back in search of prying eyes and almost loses her balance. “We need to go back. Mr. Pagonis ordered that you were to remain in your room for the duration of the gods’ visit. He’ll kill me and bury me in that damn forest of his if he discovers you’re here,” Hellen says, trembling like a leaf in the fall.<br />
<br />“You worry too much. You’ve got to live once in a while,” I say, trying to sound carefree. Deep inside, I suspect Hellen is right. She’s not the only one that has noticed how overly fertile is the red grove’s soil.<br />
<br />Hellen’s face is chili red. “Oh, it’s that right? And what do you call living exactly? Going around dressed like the whore Queen of Babylon?” <br />
<br />I hate it when she gets like this. Sometimes I wish someone else in this house would dare to talk to me. That way, I’d have another friend to talk to when she acts up.<br />
<br />“Actually, yes. I’ve always wanted to have a silk nightgown like the one I’m wearing. I saved my dinky salary for a long time to buy it, and since I could die tomorrow, I intend to wear it any chance I’ve got,” I say, returning her attitude.<br />
<br />I adore this gown. The silk embraces me with a cool caress, like a lover coming in from a wild storm outside. I wear it with no underwear to let the soft fabric rub against my nipples. It turns me on so much, giving me bad ideas, like how nice it’d be if the gods messed with me.<br />
<br />“If Mr. Pagonis doesn’t kill me, then these gods will! They’re depraved! Did you see the video that a girl secretly recorded on her cell phone? They all shared her, like at the same time! It looked as if she were about to be split in two. I don’t know why they called them gods if they behave like demons,” Hellen says.<br />
<br />I knew precisely which video she referred to. I’d watch it countless times on my phone while... taking long, relaxing baths. If I could choose the way to go, that’d be it.<br />
<br />We arrive at the double entry doors to the dining room. All the guests are now inside, so they’ve shut the main double doors. The catering staff hired for this event goes through the service doors on the left side to enter the dining room.<br />
<br />Hellen and I are hiding in plain sight, behind the closed double doors.<br />
<br />“Cut it out Perse, I’m serious. We need to leave now. We’re doomed if the security staff sees us here,” she says, glancing around in fear, wringing her hands close to her chest.<br />
<br />“Nonsense, they are all outside guarding the perimeter, or completely wasted after stealing booze from the catering. We’re safe. I just want to take a peek at the gods, and then we’ll go back, I promise.”<br />
<br />I’m not too worried because I fucked many of the security guards—only the cute ones though—in exchange for their silence when they see me sneaking out of the house to paint at the red grove.<br />
<br />I’ve always wanted to see the gods in the flesh. Every night, I fantasize about them. I still risk a beating if I encounter a guard I haven’t fucked, but this is my best, and possibly only chance in a lifetime.<br />
<br />I crouch down to look through the old lock, holding the floral crown on my head to prevent it from falling off.<br />
<br />Today is the summer solstice. I always celebrate it by visiting the nearby red grove,  and weaving a floral crown from the wildflowers I find there.<br />
<br />One sneak peek through the keyhole reveals three tables in the formal dining room.<br />
<br />There’s one large table to the left, parallel to the wall, where twenty people sit. I don’t recognize any of them, so they must be executives from the pharmaceutical conglomerate owned by the gods.<br />
<br />There’s another equally long table alongside the wall to the right, with another twenty people. Many of them seem familiar. They must be VIPs from Mr. Pagonis’ company.<br />
<br />Between these two tables is a runway leading to the main table, which is located further into the room. This central table is parallel to the double doors.<br />
<br />Mr. Pagonis sits in the middle of the primary table. His Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operations Officer sit to his right. Boring men.<br />
<br />All four gods sit to the left of the main table, with their leader seated in the center, next to Mr. Pagonis.<br />
<br />I recognize each god from paparazzi candids posted on gossip websites. The gods rarely make public appearances, and when they do, they prohibit recordings.<br />
<br />I never understood why. They’re absolutely gorgeous. They look to be in their mid-twenties with strong, lean builds. If I were half as hot as the gods are, I’d strut around naked all the time. Seriously, how can they deny the world such beauty?<br />
<br />“Who’s the god next to Mr. Pagonis, the one with dark flowy hair? What’s up with his eyes? They’re so light he looks possessed,” says Hellen.<br />
<br />I look up at her. She’s smashing her face against the gap between the double doors, peering at the gods. Her piqued interest amuses me. It’s so predictable. I know because that god has bewitched me too.<br />
<br />“That’s their leader, Lord Hades,” I say. “There’s some speculation that he’s British, because people who’ve heard him speak say he has a slight accent,” I say.<br />
<br />“Oof, that’s my weakness, I love guys with sexy accents. He’s so handsome. He must have an humongous dick,” Hellen says with admiration.<br />
<br />“You just declared him public enemy number one just five minutes ago and now you want to fuck him?”<br />
<br />I’m irrationally jealous, and I don’t understand why.<br />
<br />This is the closest I’ll ever get to Hades. Why would I think something else is possible? He can have whoever he wants. He’s unfathomably rich, gorgeous beyond words, and literally a god. I’m no one, just damaged goods too sick to be worth anything. My own guardian forces me to work as his maid, and beats me up when I disobey him, so I’d never mistake him for a loving father figure.<br />
<br />“This is all your fault. You’ve infected me with your shrieking fangirl syndrome,” Hellen says as she stands up from her hunched position.<br />
<br />I fake a laugh to diffuse our animosity.<br />
<br />She said nothing but the truth. It’s me who should get a grip and accept my pathetic reality.<br />
<br />I take one last peek at the gods. A stunning woman with long, red hair approaches Hades and whispers in his ear. He nods, and she leaves the room. They both act professionally, but something in their demeanor shows they’ve known each other for a long time.<br />
<br />Is she his lover? I shake my head and chuckle. What do I care? It’s not like Hades will ever become my boyfriend or anything.<br />
<br />I sigh with resignation.<br />
<br />“Okay, you win. Let’s go back to my room”—I say when an oddly irregular click-clack noise spooks me. When I turn towards the sound, a tall, waif-like model with waist-length blonde hair and a golden bandage dress wobbles in zigzags toward us.<br />
<br />The atypical noise results from her wearing a single stiletto. Her other shoe, featuring a torn heel, dangles from her left hand.<br />
<br />Her spaced-out eyes and the white powder under her nose tell the story. However, what really catches my attention is the ancient crown precariously hanging in her right hand. The crown is made of a strange black material. I’ve seen nothing like it in my life. Is it iron? Onyx? The design is simple. A black diadem with an ornament in front that looks like a minimalist crest: two arcs, one on top of the other, with a line crossing the center from north to south.<br />
<br />The blonde girl looks around as if searching for something. “Do you guys know… where’s the bathroom? I—I gotta pee real bad.”<br />
<br />“What do you think she’s doing here?” Hellen whispers with concern.<br />
<br />My mind flies to the moment when I overheard Mr. Pagonis confessing he was beyond broke. That he needed to secure this merger with the gods, or he’d be ruined.<br />
<br />“I think Mr. Pagonis got that crown as a gift to ingratiate himself with Lord Hades and secure the merger. He must have hired this girl to present the crown to him,” I say.<br />
<br />I might be only 19 years old, but I’m pretty sure that wasn’t her only task, or she wouldn’t have fried her brain with heroin.<br />
<br />“Poor girl, do you think the gods will…” Hellen covers her mouth with her hand, unable to finish the sentence. It’s well known that the gods possess libidos that’d made Caligula look like a blushing virgin. But Hades was the worst.<br />
<br />Yes, Hellen and I confessed our ardent desire to be ravished by the Dark Lord, but only as a fantasy. Like Hellen, I’ve heard many girls disappear after meeting the gods.<br />
<br />I’d never risk my only life to discover if the rumors are true. My heart can’t harbor any jealousy toward this girl. I pity her. “I can take you to the bathroom. Can you walk alright? Or do you want me to hold”—<br />
<br />The girl falls silent, then convulses violently, landing on top of Hellen, who screams and grasps at anything she can to keep from falling. Unfortunately for me, Hellen grabs the double door handles. When she does, the doors swing open, exposing me in the center, just as I catch the crown.<br />
<br />Golden light surrounds me. As my eyes adjust to the brightness, I realize I’m gazing at two suns setting behind green mountains. Their soft, giant curves shift, as if they were cuddling the sleepy stars, preparing for a good night’s sleep.<br />
<br />This unsettling landscape should alarm me, but somehow it feels completely natural.<br />
<br />The fresh breeze carries the perfume of sweet wine being made in the distance, caressing my skin like a kiss from summer itself. A purple butterfly with jeweled wings lands on my hand. Beauty embraces me everywhere I look.<br />
<br />Two strong arms wrap around my waist from behind. Alarmed, I turn around and I’m confronted by two diamond-like eyes shining with the purest white light.<br />
<br />Lustrous black hair flows around a familiar masculine face. He has a square jaw and a smile that could melt all the glaciers in the world. He’s wearing a crown. <br />
<br />It can’t be. It’s Hades.<br />
<br />“Ready?” he whispers lovingly as he kisses my forehead.<br />
<br />I’m about to ask him what he means when my feet shake. When the initial surprise wears off, I realize that what’s actually moving is the ground. An earthquake. My lover is gone, along with all the warmth and beauty. Only darkness remains.<br />
<br />Stabbing pain in my right palm screams at me. The next thing I know, I’m back at the double doors.<br />
<br />There is a wound in my hand, in the exact place where my birthmark is.<br />
<br />I inspect the crown for a jagged edge—the room spins when I realize this crown is the same one Hades wore in the vision.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />





<h3>Chapter 3: Hades</h3>
<br />
<br />
<br />“Lord Hades, I pray you’d accept this humble offer. This ancient crown once belonged to a powerful king, yet we all accept that this relic is unworthy of such a mighty god as you”—<br />
<br />I tune out Lucidus Pagonis’ sycophantic rant. <br />
<br />When is he going to shut up? I haven’t eaten all day. What kind of idiot babbles first and serves dinner last?<br />
<br />I knew I shouldn’t have come.<br />
<br />I gesture at the waiter to bring me another glass of red wine to dull my hunger.<br />
<br />“Watch out. Remember the last time you got drunk and fucked a girl? I bet the poor thing couldn’t walk for a month. Whoever you’ll fuck tonight is in for a wild ride,” says Hermes in a frequency so low that it’s inaudible to human ears.<br />
<br />I nail him with an icy stare.<br />
<br />“Our king doesn’t need alcohol to wreck a woman. Psychopathy comes naturally to him, isn’t that true?” says Ares, raising his glass of wine in a mocking toast.<br />
<br />They all laugh.<br />
<br />I down a vineyard’s worth of wine. “Fuck off, I’m still covered in someone’s blood”—<br />
<br />A commotion at the double doors commands a hermetic silence in the room. <br />
<br />The doors forcefully open wide to reveal a stunning young woman holding a black crown. She’s dressed in a long, creamy silk nightgown, with no lingerie in sight, and looking deliciously dazed.<br />
<br />My cock gets rock hard in an instant.<br />
<br />I take a good look at her face.<br />
<br />“Who’s she?”—Ares asks, but then stops himself. The shock in my face is unmistakable.<br />
<br />It’s her.<br />
<br />The primordial goddess. After centuries of searching for her, she’s the one who found me.<br />
<br />I stand up and walk to the front of our table, needing to be closer to her, even if it’s a few steps. <br />
<br />Her erect nipples are visible through the sheer fabric. I lick my lips in anticipation of sucking on them and sinking my fangs into her juicy flesh.<br />
<br />The mouthwatering scent of her sex consumes me with the heat of a thousand wildfires.<br />
<br />“Your lordship,” she says, curtsying while looking down, almost with shyness. Her heavy coldness knives me. Gone is the husky voice that panted my name many nights. <br />
<br />I will hear it again soon.<br />
<br />I nod, acknowledging her. <br />
<br />When she looks up again, all modesty is gone. Fire and recognition war in her eyes. She knows who I am, just as well as I know who she is.<br />
<br />She extinguishes the flames of her desire, and duty takes over.<br />
<br />She lifts the crown with solemnity as if the future of all life on Earth depended on it.<br />
<br />I bend my neck so she can place the crown on my head.<br />
<br />It pains me to see the care she’s taking not to touch me. I know she’s just following the protocol, though I wish she’d feel me all over, unable to control herself.<br />
<br />As she lowers her hands to her sides, a spark of the past ignites in her mind. She examines a cut on her right palm, dabs her left index finger into the bloody wound, and raises it toward my forehead.<br />
<br />She traces the sigil of our race on my skin, two arcs stacked with a line intersecting them. Just like she did hundreds of years ago, in a ritual lost in the oceans of time. <br />
<br />The audience gasps at the gross breach of protocol, jolting her out of  the trance.<br />
<br />“I’m sorry. I don’t know what came over me. I”—<br />
<br />I capture her left hand, kiss it, and place it over my heart. “Persephone, my queen.”<br />
<br />Her lips part in shock. Terrified, she takes a step backward. She’s fighting the truth, wanting to escape me. I won’t lose her. Not again. Never again.<br />
<br />I grab the back of her neck to keep her captive while I ravage her mouth with mine. She tastes sweeter than ambrosia. I imprison her waist with my other arm and crush her body against me, fondling all her curves with unashamed abandon, her softness setting me ablaze.<br />
<br />She’s mine. Forever mine. <br />
<br />I bite her lower lip. Drops of her sweet blood overwhelm my senses with lust and awe. I can’t help but groan in pleasure. <br />
<br />I taste her divinity, eons of power flowing through her as if life never left her. As if she never left me. <br />
<br />I pierce my lip with my fangs, forcing her to swallow my blood. She moans when my blood hits her tongue. The scent of her arousal sets my blood alight. Before I know it, I lift her nightgown and cup her sex. Her heated cunt is lusciously wet. I caress her along her entrance and tease the soft nub on top. She gasps at my audacity. She’s right. There’s no time for pleasure now. I must finish the claiming ritual.<br />
<br />Against my will, I break our kiss.<br />
<br />I look into her eyes. She’s all fire and fight until I say, “you’re one of us now.” Her eyes widen and she becomes utterly still. Her expression changes from shock to confusion.<br />
<br />I angle my head towards the left side of her neck, biting down with sufficient force to break her skin and force a few drops of blood out.<br />
<br />She screams.<br />
<br />Our queen has finally arrived. I’ve marked and claimed her. <br />
<br />“She’s ours, boys!” I exclaim toward our table.<br />
<br />Ares and Hermes go bonkers, jumping on the table and kicking the wine glasses wildly, regardless of where or on whom they land. They all jump in unison in a ridiculous group hug. They’re cheering, wolf-whistling, and clapping.<br />
<br />Thanatos is nowhere in sight.<br />
<br />Their celebration shatters the table with a thunderous roar. Ares and Hermes land on their feet with impossible grace.<br />
<br />I was so engrossed in our happiness that I overlooked Lucidus standing next to me. His face has lost all color, and tears are welling in his eyes. His wretched condition reminds me I haven’t answered his question.<br />
<br />“I accept,” I say.<br />
<br />“W-what did you say, my lord?” Lucidus replies.<br />
<br />“I accept your offer. I’m most pleased with it.” I gaze at the paradise found that is the face of my new queen. My cock twitches again at the sight of my mark on her neck, eager to take what is his.<br />
<br />I hug her waist to bring her closer to my side possessively, and kill any ideas Lucidus may concoct to thwart our union.<br />
<br />“I will sign the acquisition,” I say.<br />
<br />My feet move the debris left by the broken table until I find the paperwork. The document is ruined with wine stains, footprints, and holes wood splinters tore through.<br />
<br />I blow on it to remove dust and shake off glass fragments.<br />
<br />I search my pockets but I can’t find any pens. Ares and Hermes rummage through the shattered table, patting their bodies and the men who shared the table with us, but come up empty-handed too.<br />
<br />I shrug and prick my index finger with my fang. I grab Lucidus, spin him around to use his back as an improvised table, and sign the acquisition documents with my blood. When I hand him the contract, his hands tremble.<br />
<br />“Pleasure to do business with you. My attorneys will contact you tomorrow to get a copy of the contract. I’d love to stay for dinner, but I have more…” I gaze at my adorable goddess, “pressing business to tend to.”<br />
<br />He collapses to his knees as if a chainsaw severed his calves.<br />
<br />“M-my lord, I beg for your mercy. There has been a terrible mistake. Persephone is my ward. I’ve raised her since she was a child. She’s like my daughter, the light of my eyes. She was never part of this deal. The crown is a priceless, irreplaceable treasure. It’s all yours. I can get you twenty younger, more beautiful women who will be eager to please you in the blink of an eye, but I beg of you, spare Persephone”—<br />
<br />I raise my open hand in front of his face to stop his groveling.<br />
<br />Goosebumps cover the delicate skin of my queen because of her fear of me. Though fear is not her only emotion. Her blood pressure rises like a fiery tornado of indignation. Her lips sneer first, then contort downwards in disgust.<br />
<br />The small yellow spots on her forearm, a sure sign of a defensive injury, confirm my suspicions.<br />
<br />She realizes the gravity of the situation when my righteous fury erupt in response to her old bruise. “No, please don’t! He’s my guardian. He was only trying to protect me,” she implores with both hands on my chest.<br />
<br />I glance at Ares and Hermes. They’re close behind me already.<br />
<br />A button clicks. From the corner of my eye, I see Lucidus’ hand moving within his pocket.<br />
<br />A distress button.<br />
<br />I send an electromagnetic pulse to disable all electronics in the room.<br />
<br />The guests, who have been recording our interaction with their phones, look confused as they try to turn them back on, oblivious to what just happened.<br />
<br />My fingertip touches the signed acquisition contract, setting it aflame. Lucidus yelps in pain as the fire cooks his skin. I grab him by the collar, until his little feet kick in the air.<br />
<br />I rip out his jugular with my fangs. A broken dam’s worth of bitter, unremarkable human blood floods my mouth.<br />
<br />“No!” Persephone screams as she hurls her body forward to save him. She struggles to break free from my hold. I toss Lucidus, as one does with a soiled napkin, and he falls unceremoniously on the floor. <br />
<br />Lucidus’ hands try frantically to stop the rivers of life from escaping him. But this tidal wave of death has rolled already.<br />
<br />Dozens of terrified guests unleash pandemonium as they stampede toward the exit.<br />
<br />A convoy of armored Humvees rumbles as they approach, no doubt overflowing with mercenaries contracted by Lucidus in case things went awry.<br />
<br />“Ares!” I scream amid the chaos.<br />
<br />“Yes, my king!” Ares says.<br />
<br />“Protect the queen with your life.”<br />
<br />I grab the back of my queen’s knees and waist and throw her to Ares, who catches her with one arm.<br />
<br />I’ll need all of my focus to win this fight. I’m beyond exhausted, but I cannot lose this battle. Not now, when I’ve finally got her back. <br />
<br />Hermes positions himself on my left, ready to raise hell.<br />
<br />“Where is Thanatos?” I yell at him.<br />
<br />Hermes shrugs.<br />
<br />Of all nights, Thanatos chooses this one to disappear on us. Where the hell did he go?<br />
<br />A clangor at the double doors snaps my attention. The guests are no longer fleeing. They’re piled up on motionless heaps on the floor.
