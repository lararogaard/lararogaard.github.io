          <h3>Pollux</h3>
          <h4>Thebes, Greece, 727 BC</h4>
          <h4>(Hermes backstory)</h4>
<br />
<br />
<br />


<br />"Come back here!" I scream. I try to stand up in the pond, but my tunic is drenched to the skin. My muscles failed to account for its new weight, causing me to fall again.<br />
<br />"You’re it!" Castor, my twin brother, bolts, leaving me to eat his dust.<br />
<br />I run after him in vain. He’s always bested me at everything. And I love him the more for it. How can I not? He’s always been there for me. And for anyone who needs help. Everyone loves Castor. He’ll be a fair and beloved Lord.<br />
<br />My lungs burn from the effort, while Castor increases the distance between us without breaking a sweat, as he heads for the designated safe zone. If he reaches it, I’ll have to do his chores for a week.<br />
<br />Before I know it, I lift his left feet in the air, causing him to lose his rhythm, trip and fall.<br />
<br />Pleased with myself, I sprint and finally catch up with him.<br />
<br />"You’re it!" I say as I touch him on the shoulder. Panting, I start to run towards the safe zone.<br />
<br />"Wait. No need to run to the safe zone. Yes, you won. I’ll do your shit for seven days. Whatever. Tell me how you did it?"<br />
<br />A cold dread invades me.<br />
<br />"W-what do you mean? I won fair and square," I try to feign innocence, but my voice cracks. I’ve never been good at lying. Another subject in which Castor is superior He smells lies from a mile away.<br />
<br />"How did you make me trip?"<br />
<br />"I didn’t."<br />
<br />"Yes, you did. There were no rocks nearby. No reason for me to stumble."<br />
<br />"You can’t always win. You’re not as invincible as you think you are." He’s cornering me. I can’t let him know. He must never know.<br />
<br />"Why are you lying? You’re my twin brother. We share everything. I’m not even mad that you cheated, I’m just curious." He stands up, coming straight for me.<br />
<br />"Just let it go. Don’t be a sore loser."<br />
<br />"Show me how you did it. Did you buy an amulet from a sorcerer? Did you hide it in your clothes?" He pulls my tunic and pads me all over looking for it.<br />
<br />"Get away from me!"<br />
<br />"Why are you overreacting? What are you hiding? I just want to see how the amulet works. I’m not going to steal it."<br />
<br />He keeps prodding me despite my pleas. <br />
<br />We wrestle.<br />
<br />I lose it.<br />
<br />I hold him by the neck.<br />
<br />Castor panics when he cannot find purchase with his feet. He looks down to find he’s four feet above the ground.<br />
<br />I realize what I’ve done and drop him.<br />
<br />He lands with a thud and stares up at me, as I’m still suspended in the air. I’m so agitated that I’m unable to reign in my power and reach the ground.<br />
<br />"Blessed One!" He gets on his knees and worships me.<br />
<br />"Oh my gods! What are you doing? Get up! You’re my twin! Stop embarrassing yourself!"<br />
<br />I finally manage to land. I get him up and dust him off.<br />
<br />"I told you to stop. Someone could have seen us."<br />
<br />"What do you mean? You’ve been touched by the gods! We need to tell everybody! Wait. This is not the first time it has happened, right? How long have you been doing this?"<br />
<br />"A few months."<br />
<br />"What! Why haven’t you told anyone?"<br />
<br />"I went to the oracle to ask her about it. She was quite cryptic. I couldn’t understand all that she said, but the gist of it was that it didn’t seem like the best idea."<br />
<br />"Have the gods made you insane too? They’ll make you a Lord. No, scratch that. They’ll make you Chieftain, or even King! You can appoint me as your advisor, and we’ll sail across the seven seas, conquering new territories! We’ll be so rich!”<br />
<br />"No. Listen. The Chieftain is a jealous man. I’ve heard rumors about what he’s done to others like me—"<br />
<br />"Bullcrap. He’s a businessman first. We’re at war. At any moment, he’ll come here to take father and his men to join the battle. When we show your powers to the enemy, they’ll surrender in fright. No man wants to wage war against the gods. You’ll be our secret weapon to win battles without shedding a drop of blood!"<br />
<br />"No, he’ll kill me—"<br />
<br />"I’m so proud of you, brother. You’ve always rooted for my ascension to power. You’ve accepted that I’d be the one to rule our house, even though you were born just mere seconds after me. It could have been you. But you were never bitter. You always loved me unconditionally. I love you too, my dear Pollux, and now it’s my turn to root for you. You don’t need to hide in my shadow anymore. The gods have rewarded your loyalty. Don’t you see? It was always you who were meant to rule. I was just a placeholder."<br />
<br />He dashes towards our palace.<br />
<br />"Castor no!"<br />
<br />I can’t use my gift to stop him. There are too many people around. Why are there so many people? <br />
<br />Lyre melodies fill the air.<br />
<br />My heart drops to the center of the underworld.<br />
<br />No, no, no! Gods no! Of all days! Not today!<br />
<br />It’s too late. <br />
<br />Castor reached father and the Chieftain at the gardens.<br />
<br />"Here he is! The one and only, Lord Pollux." He bows towards me. "Don’t let his modesty deceive you. The Gods have chosen him as the true ruler of this house. Hell, maybe to be the ruler of the whole city."<br />
<br />"Ruler of the whole city, hmm?" The Chieftain signals silence to the lyre players.<br />
<br />"Why yes. You should send him to win battles too. He’d be the most valuable asset. I could go too, as his body double, to keep him safe in case of an assassination attempt," Castor adds, then winks at me discreetly.<br />
<br />The Chieftain walks towards me ever so slowly. Then he encircles me. <br />
<br />"Show me," his whisper freezes my blood.<br />
<br />"Lord Chieftain, I must confess. I deceived my brother. I used an artifice to make it look as if I had been touched by the gods. It was all in jest. Please forgive me," I say.<br />
<br />Castor’s jaw hangs open.<br />
<br />"Did you lie to your Chieftain?"<br />
<br />I get on my knees and melt in apologies.<br />
<br />"I beg for your mercy Lord Chieftain—" <br />
<br />"I’m addressing Castor. Answer me."<br />
<br />Castor pales.<br />
<br />"I-I, no, my Lord Chieftain. I saw it with my own eyes. Pollux is shy, he’s afraid of notoriety—"<br />
<br />"Do you know what we do to liars in my city?"<br />
<br />My heart rate speeds up so much, my chest is about to explode. Is the Chieftain going to lash him? In front of father? No, he wouldn’t dare. Father brings in more gold to his coffers than all the other Lords in the region. <br />
<br />My father screams.<br />
<br />"My Lord Chieftain, my son is a youth! Take me instead!" He sprints towards Castor, but the Chieftain’s entourage stops him.<br />
<br />Castor falls on his knees. <br />
<br />"My Lord Chieftain, I swear to you by the mighty Zeus and all the Pantheon, I saw—"<br />
<br />Blood splatters my eyes. All I see are the red clouds of death.<br />
<br />The Chieftain takes the head of Castor and throws it at the feet of my father, who falls to the ground, his heart stopping at the same time as his firstborn’s.<br />
<br />The decapitated corpse of my brother lies so still on the ground. It’s so strange to see him so still. Castor was always so lively. This is so unlike him.<br />
<br />The forceful stream of blood from his neck has been reduced to a trickle now. But his red sea expands on the ground, as if reaching out to ask me why I lied. I’m alive, but he told the truth and is dead. <br />
<br />I levitate so his inquiring blood doesn’t taint my skin. <br />
<br />There’s no need.<br />
<br />The sin of his unjust death will forever burn in my heart.<br />
<br />Sparks crackle in my fingertips, forming a fireball when the oxygen around them feeds them.<br />
<br />A comet-like blaze of justice unleashes, cleansing all the wickedness that polluted this holy ground.<br />
<br />When there’s nothing left to purify but my own lying heart, I turn around and walk away.
